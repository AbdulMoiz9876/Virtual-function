# Virtual-function
A virtual function in C++ is a base class member function that you can redefine in a derived class to achieve polymorphism. 
You can declare the function in the base class using the virtual keyword. 
Once you declare the function in the base class, you can use a pointer or reference to call the virtual class and execute its virtual version in the derived class.
Thus, it asks the compiler to determine the objectâ€™s type during run-time and create a function bind (late binding or dynamic linkage).
